# Nuxt.js with Cypress

A [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) + [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) starter project template without the distraction of a complicated development environment.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate

# run e2e tests with cypress - (You must start server before this)
$ yarn e2e

# run and open e2e tests with cypress - (You must start server before this)
$ yarn e2e:open
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
